## INSTALLATION

**Requirements**

- **Python** – [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
  During installation, check **Add Python to PATH** so you can run `python` from any folder.

- **Git** – [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/install/windows).  
  Required because one dependency is installed directly from GitHub.

- **Chrome for Testing** – [googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing](https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing).  
  Choose the build for your operating system (required for the top.gg voting feature). Reference image: [assets/tips/chrome_binary.png](assets/tips/chrome_binary.png)

**Get the code**

- **Download ZIP** - on the [repo page](https://github.com/realphamdat/phamdat-selfbot), press *Code* then *Download ZIP*, and extract the folder.
- **Or clone** - open a terminal anywhere:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/realphamdat/phamdat-selfbot.git
```

**Install dependencies**

Open a terminal inside the project folder and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Add your data**

Put your settings and tokens into the `data/` folder first - this is covered in [SETUP](#setup). The tool reads these files when it starts.

**Run**

```bash
python main.py
```

The tool starts a local web page. Open `http://localhost:2010` in your browser to **start/stop the macro, solve captchas and edit your data**. From another device on the same network, open `http://<IP shown in terminal>:2010`.

## SETUP

<details>
<summary><b>HOW DATA WORKS</b></summary>

All settings live in the `data/` folder. You edit these files, then start the bot.

**Bot and extensions**

The tool has one **bot** and two **extensions**. Each module reads only its own file - a token in `owo.json` does not appear in the other files by itself. List an account in each file where you want it to work.

| Kind | Name | Config file |
|------|------|-------------|
| Bot | OwO | `data/owo.json` |
| Extension | Quest | `data/quest.txt` |
| Extension | Top.gg | `data/topgg.txt` |

The **bot** farms OwO (daily, quests, checklists, vote, huntbot, boss, gems, gambling...). The **extensions** run separate tasks - Discord quests and top.gg voting. They are independent - fill a file to turn a module on, empty it to turn it off.

**Multi-account**

In the JSON files, the **top-level key is a Discord account token** - each key is one account, handled on its own. To add an account, add a token key. To remove one, delete that key.

```json
{
    "TOKEN_A": { "...": "..." },
    "TOKEN_B": { "...": "..." }
}
```

**Data types**

| Type | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| String | text, inside quotes | `"owo"` |
| Number | a number, no quotes | `12` |
| Boolean | true or false, no quotes | `true` |
| List | several values inside `[ ]` | `[1, 2, 3]` |
| Object | a nested group inside `{ }` | `{"min": 5, "max": 10}` |

**Rules to know**

- A key you leave out keeps its **default** value. A minimal account is just `"YOUR_TOKEN": {}`.
- Use a **list** to allow several IDs (channels, ...). Use a plain number for a single ID.
- `quest.txt` and `topgg.txt` are plain text, not JSON: one entry per line, `#` for comments.
- `settings.json` is **global** and is not keyed by token.
- `caches.json` is written by the tool - do not edit it.
- Edit the files first, then start the tool. Starting always reloads every account from the data files.

<details>
<summary><b>OwO</b>  -  Bot  -  <code>data/owo.json</code></summary>

    }
}
```

| `prefix` | String | `owo` | Prefix for every OwO command |
| `check_status` | Boolean | `true` | Pause the account if OwO seems offline |

|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `when_mentioned` | Boolean | `true` | Switch channel when the account is mentioned |
| `when_challenge` | Boolean | `true` | Switch channel after a battle challenge |

| `crate` | Boolean | `true` | Open crates |
| `flootbox` | Boolean | `false` | Open the special flootboxes |

**gamble**:

| Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `lottery` | Object | *(below)* | Lottery |
| `slot` | Object | *(below)* | Slot machine |
| `coinflip` | Object | *(below)* | Coin flip |
| `blackjack` | Object | *(below)* | Blackjack |

| `cooldown` | Object | `{"min": 30, "max": 60}` | Pause between cycles (seconds) |

Each game has a `mode` switch (default `false`) to turn it on. All games are off by default.

| Game | `mode` | `bet` | `rate` | `max` |
|------|--------|-------|--------|-------|
| slot | false | 1 | 2 | 250000 |
| coinflip | false | 1 | 2 | 250000 |
| blackjack | false | 1 | 2 | 250000 |
| highlow | false | 10 | 2 | 250000 |

For every game: `bet` is the base bet (highlow is forced to a minimum of 10), `rate` multiplies the next bet after a loss and `max` is the highest bet allowed. `lottery` uses `amount` (default `1`) - its tickets per daily reset.

When **two or more** accounts are set up, friend quests (battle, cookie, pray, curse, action) are solved by the other accounts automatically.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Quest</b>  -  Extension  -  <code>data/quest.txt</code></summary>

Completes Discord quests (watch a video, play on desktop, stream, play an activity). This is a different thing from the OwO `quest` key above - it is for Discord's own quest system. It talks to Discord's HTTP API directly, so it does not use the bot gateway. All tokens run together.

```txt
# one token per line
TOKEN_A
TOKEN_B
```

Plain text, one token per line. Lines starting with `#` are ignored. There is nothing else to configure.

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Top.gg</b>  -  Extension  -  <code>data/topgg.txt</code></summary>

Votes for any bot on top.gg. This is a different thing from the OwO `vote` key above - that one votes the OwO bot with the account's own token, this one votes any bot id with any token. It opens Chrome for Testing for every vote, so the browser from the requirements is required.

```txt
# one token + one bot id per line
TOKEN_A 408785106942164992
TOKEN_B 408785106942164992
```

Plain text, one token and one bot id per line. Lines starting with `#` are ignored. After a successful vote, the account waits for the top.gg cooldown before it votes again. There is nothing else to configure.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>settings.json</b>  -  Global</summary>

Not keyed by token - one file for the whole tool. Optional.

When any account hits a captcha, the web app already shows it. If `discord_webhook` is set, the tool also posts a Discord alert so you get pinged (for example at night).

```json
{
    "discord_webhook": {
        "url": "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/...",
        "content": "@everyone @here <@&role_id> <@user_id>"
    }
}
```

| Key | Type | Default | Purpose |
|-----|------|---------|---------|
| `url` | String | *(none)* | Webhook URL that receives the alert |
| `content` | String | `@everyone @here` | Mention text sent with the alert |

Each alert sends your `content` mentions plus an embed titled **CAPTCHA DETECTED** with the account's name and a link to the captcha message.

</details>

## IMPORTANCE

### Tips

- **Open the web UI from another device** on the same network: `http://<IP printed in terminal>:2010`.
- **Avoid using overly short or generic names** such as "bear", "pink", ".,;:?!@#$%^&*" or similar. These names are highly likely to overlap with other players, which can confuse the system during message recognition and may even cause serious errors. Choose a distinct, clear, and uncommon name instead. A name like "Phamdat" can still work if it is not commonly used, because the system relies on the name to accurately match bot replies.
- **Do not attach too many accounts to the same channel**. Doing so can flood the message flow, reduce efficiency, and make the system less reliable. If it is unavoidable, proceed with caution and only when absolutely necessary.

### OwO

- **Do not let the inventory become too large**. An overloaded inventory can trigger excessive message overflow, and the system may only recognize the first inventory message while later ones are skipped. This prevents important information from being scanned correctly. Avoid buying large quantities of rings, stacking thousands of boxes, crates, and other bulk inventory items.
- **Checklist/Quest features require the correct OWO settings**. To make checklist/quest work properly, you must configure the settings from the `owobs` command, as shown in the image at [assets/tips/owo_settings.png](assets/tips/owo_settings.png). Without this setup, the checklist/quest system may not function correctly.
